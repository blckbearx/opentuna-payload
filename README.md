# Source code for OpenTuna exploit and payloads.

## How to build
First of all, you'll need the [PS2SDK](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev) installed and running in your system.  
Now, `cd` to the exploit folder and open a terminal there, then do `make` and watch it build, if nothing goes wrong you should have a "payload.bin" file in the exploit folder.  
In order to use that file, first you'll need to embed it into a forged icon in order to launch de exploit. In order to do that you'll need to use [OpenTunaRLE](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/opentuna-RLE).
